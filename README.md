# Simulated Annealing for Graph Coloring
Code to run simulated annealing on a graph of arbitrary size and connectivity c.
Graphs can be generated by editing and compiling plantstate.cpp
to compile use 
g++ testcode.cpp -std=c++11 -O3 -o testcode.out

to use plantstate:
g++ plantstate.cpp -std=c++11 -O3 -o plant
## Algorithm
The basics of the algorithm is to take a undirected graph and find a coloring which satisfies the fewest possible color conflicts between connected nodes given a maximum number of colors.

The basis of this is to start with a random coloring, and then iterate through the graph
